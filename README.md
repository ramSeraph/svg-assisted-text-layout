# svg-assisted-text-layout

Experiments to extract text metrics from svg rendered text using the DOM apis and use them to extract boundaries of typographical characters of the same text rendered on a canvas and extract the image data of these typographical character extents.

These image data can be used to later render text on curves directly or using SDFs

This is an experiment and a WIP.
