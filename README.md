# svg-assisted-text-layout

Experiments to extract text metrics from svg rendered text using the dom apis and use them to render the same text on a canvas and extract the image data of the typographical characters.


These image data can be used to later render text on curves directly or using SDFs

This is an experiment and a WIP.
